CSS ZenGarden activity for CSSG Web Dev team

" CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further. " ~ Original ZenGarden 

# How to get started
Clone the repository locally using the command:

$ git clone "https://github.com/srirag-vuppala/zengarden.git"

# Helpful tips

- I recommend using VScode as your editor for actually working towards the task

- To actually test your changes in html or css simply open up the html document in the browser

- To git add all the files use :

        $ git add -A

- To git commit:

        $ git commit -m"Your commit message"

# Submission 

Important: Create a separate branch for this task. You will use this branch to turn the task in at the end. Before you commit changes, make sure you create a new branch. Here's the command:

        $ git branch "name of your new branch"   *Quotes not required

To move to the new branch, you can run:

        $ git checkout "name of your new branch"  *Quotes not required

If you want to check the list of branches, simply run:

        $ git branch

After you're done with commiting locally :

        $ git push -u origin local-branch
